ADDITIONAL SCREENSHOTS

Produce screenshots illustrating the download methods in the “How to
download” section (Satori, GetTor, mirrors).

SECTIONS TO ADD/EXPAND/MODIFY

Add a section that explains how to verify the Tor Browser download in
clear and simple steps.

Expand “Using for the first time” section with guidance on
extracting/“installing” Tor Browser, and locating it in the filesystem
on each OS. Cover the need to move TB to OSX Applications folder (and
not run from disk image). Take into account the change in Mac OSX
installation once a developer cert is available (ETA: August 2015)

Modify “Bridges” page if/when we have a domain-fronted API to
autodiscover fresh bridges (ETA: December 2015)

LOCALIZATION

Plan for the localization of the manual’s text into the set of languages
for which Tor Browser is currently built; this could be done through
crowdsourced translation (on Transifex) or by individual translators.

DISTRIBUTION

Work out distribution strategies for the manual. An online copy will be
available, and could be promoted through Tor’s outreach channels and
linked to from the website. GetTor could provide links to the manual
or to a downloadable file. A file could be included in the Tor Browser
download (see discussion on #11698).

MAINTAINABILITY

Develop a clear plan for updating the manual text as Tor Browser
evolves. This will involve incorporating user
feedback/frequently-encountered issues from the help desk assistants,
and making sure that information about major user interface changes is
obtained from the Tor Browser team in good time.

OTHER SOFTWARE PRODUCTS

Continue discussion with other software development teams who might
require user documentation for their products (e.g. Tor Messenger)
