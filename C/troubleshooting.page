<title>Troubleshooting</title>

<p>
You should be able to start browsing the web using Tor Browser shortly
after running the program, and clicking the “Connect” button if you are
using it for the first time.

<title>Quick fixes</title>
<p>
If Tor Browser doesn’t connect, there may be a simple solution. Try each
of the following:
</p>

<list>
  <item>
    <p>
    Your computer’s system clock must be set correctly, or Tor will not
    be able to connect.
    </p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <p>
    Make sure another Tor Browser is not already running. If you’re 
    not sure if Tor Browser is running, restart your computer.
    </p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <p>
    Make sure that any antivirus program you have installed is not
    preventing Tor from running. You may need to consult the
    documentation for your antivirus software if you do not know how to
    do this.
    </p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <p>
    Temporarily disable your firewall.
    </p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <p>
    Delete Tor Browser and install it again. If updating, do not just
    overwrite your previous Tor Browser files; ensure they are fully
    deleted beforehand.

If you still can’t connect, your Internet Service Provider might be
censoring connections to the Tor network. Read the <link
