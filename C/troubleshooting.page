<title>Troubleshooting</title>

<p>
You should be able to start browsing the web using Tor Browser shortly
after running the program, and clicking the “Connect” button if you are
using it for the first time.

<title>Quick fixes</title>
<p>
If Tor Browser doesn’t connect, there may be a simple solution. Try each
of the following:
</p>

<list>
  <item>
    <p>
    Your computer’s system clock must be set correctly, or Tor will not
    be able to connect.
    </p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <p>
    Make sure another Tor Browser is not already running. If you’re 
    not sure if Tor Browser is running, restart your computer.
    </p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <p>
    Make sure that any antivirus program you have installed is not
    preventing Tor from running. You may need to consult the
    documentation for your antivirus software if you do not know how to
    do this.
    </p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <p>
    Temporarily disable your firewall.
    </p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <p>
    Delete Tor Browser and install it again. If updating, do not just
    overwrite your previous Tor Browser files; ensure they are fully
    deleted beforehand.

<title>Is your connection censored?</title>
<p>
If you still can’t connect, your Internet Service Provider might be
censoring connections to the Tor network. Read the <link
xref='circumvention'>Circumvention</link> section for possible
solutions.

<section id="known-issues">
<title>Known issues</title>
<p>
Tor Browser is under constant development, and some issues are known
about but not yet fixed. Please check the <link
xref='known-issues'>Known Issues</link> page to see if the problem you
are experiencing is already listed there.

<section id="helpdesk">
<title>Contacting the Tor Help Desk</title>
<p>
If the above steps do not help you solve the problem, you can contact
Tor’s help desk. Send an email to help@rt.torproject.org with exact
details of the problem, your operating system, and the steps you have
already tried. Please only contact the help desk if you cannot find the
answer to your question in this manual.
</p>

<p>
If possible, you should also include the “Tor log”, an
automatically-generated list of Tor’s activity that can help diagnose
the problem. To copy the Tor log, either:
</p>
<list>
 <item>
  <p>
  click the button labelled “Copy Tor Log To Clipboard” that appears in
  the dialog window while Tor Browser is connecting to the network, or
  </p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <p>
  if Tor Browser is already open, click on the Torbutton icon (the small
  green onion at the top left of the screen), then “Open Network
  Settings”, then “Copy Tor Log To Clipboard”.
  </p>
 </item>
</list>
<p>
You can now paste the Tor log into your support request.
