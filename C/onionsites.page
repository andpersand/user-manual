<title>Onion Services</title>
<p>
Onion services (also known as “hidden services”) are services (like websites) 
that are only accessible through the Tor network.
</p>

<p>
Onion services offer several advantages over ordinary services on the
non-private web:

  <p>
  An onion services’s location and IP address are hidden, making it difficult
  for adversaries to censor it or identify its operators.

  <p>
  All traffic between Tor users and onion services is end-to-end encrypted,
  so you do not need to worry about <link
  xref='secure-connections'>connecting over HTTPS</link>.
  </p>

  The address of an onion service is automatically generated, so the
  operators do not need to purchase a domain name; the .onion URL also
  helps Tor ensure that it is connecting to the right location and that
  the connection is not being tampered with.

Just like any other website, you will need to know the address of an
onion service in order to connect to it. An onion address is a string of
sixteen mostly random letters and numbers, followed by “.onion”.

If you cannot reach the onion service you require, make sure that you have
entered the 16-character onion address correctly: even a small mistake
will stop Tor Browser from being able to reach the site.
</p>
<p>
If you are still unable to connect to the onion service, please try again
later. There may be a temporary connection issue, or the site operators
may have allowed it to go offline without warning.
