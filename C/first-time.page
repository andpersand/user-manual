  <title>Running Tor Browser for the first time</title>
  
  <p>
  When you run Tor Browser for the first time, you will see the Tor
  Network Settings window. This offers you the option to connect directly to the
  Tor network, or to configure Tor Browser for your connection.
  </p>
  
  <section id="connect">

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
    In most cases, choosing "Connect" will allow you to connect to the Tor network
    without any further configuration. Once clicked, a status bar will
    appear, showing Tor’s connection progress. If you are on a relatively
    fast connection, but this bar seems to get stuck at a certain point,
    see the <link xref='troubleshooting'>Troubleshooting</link> page for
    help solving the problem.

   If you know that your connection is censored, or uses a proxy, you should
   select this option. Tor Browser will take you through a series of
   configuration options.
   </p>
   <steps>
    <item>
     <p>
     The first screen asks if access to the Tor network is blocked or
     censored on your connection. If you do not believe this is the case,
     select “No”. If you know your connection is censored, or you have
     tried and failed to connect to the Tor network and no other solutions
     have worked, select “Yes”. You will then be taken to the <link
     xref='circumvention'>Circumvention</link> screen to configure
     a pluggable transport.
     </p>
    </item>
    <item>
     <p>
     The next screen asks if your connection uses a proxy. In most cases,
     this is not necessary. You will usually know if you need to answer
     “Yes”, as the same settings will be used for other browsers on your
     system. If possible, ask your network administrator for guidance. If
     your connection does not use a proxy, click “Continue”.
