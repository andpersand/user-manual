<title>Circumvention</title>

<p>
Direct access to the Tor network may sometimes be blocked by your Internet
Service Provider or by a government. Tor Browser includes some
circumvention tools for getting around these blocks. These tools are called
“pluggable transports”. See the <link xref='transports'>Pluggable
Transports</link> page for more  information on the types of transport
that are currently available.

<title>Using pluggable transports</title>
<steps>

  <p>
  To use pluggable transports, click "Configure" in the Tor Launcher
  window that appears when you first run Tor Browser.

  <p>
  You can also configure pluggable transports while Tor Browser is
  running, by clicking on the Torbutton menu and selecting “Tor Network
  Settings”.

  <p>
  Select “yes” when asked if your Internet Service Provider blocks
  connections to the Tor network.

  <p>
  Select “Connect with provided bridges”. Tor Browser currently has nine
  pluggable transport options to choose from. If one fails to get you
  online, try selecting a different transport.
  </p>

</steps>

<p>
If you try all of these options, and none of them gets you online,
you will need to enter bridge addresses manually. Read the <link 
xref='bridges'>Bridges</link> section to learn what bridges are and how
to obtain them.
